================

Modified from [codeigniter-twiggy](https://github.com/edmundask/codeigniter-twiggy).

# Installation

Download Twig

```
composer req twig/twig
```

Download this package and extract to `application/third_party`.

Open file `application/config/autoload.php` and load this package.

```
$autoload['packages'] = array(APPPATH.'third_party/Twig');
```

Load the library.

```
$autoload['libraries'] = array('twig'');
```

# How To Use It

## 1. Set up dir structure

1. Create a directory structure:

    ```
    +-{APPPATH}/
    | +-themes/
    | | +-default/
    | | | +-_layouts/
    ```

    NOTE: `{APPPATH}` is the folder where all your controllers, models and other neat stuff is placed.
    By default that folder is called `application`.

2. Create a default layout `index.html.twig` and place it in _layouts  folder:

    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <!--[if lt IE 9]>
            <script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
            <![endif]-->
            <title>Default layout</title>
        </head>
        <body>

            {% block content %}{% endblock %}

        </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. Create a default template file `index.html.twig` at the root of `default` theme folder:

    ```
    {% extends _layout %}

    {% block content %}

        Default template file.

    {% endblock %}
    ```

4. You should end up with a structure like this:

    ```
    +-{APPPATH}/
    | +-themes/
    | | +-default/
    | | | +-_layouts/
    | | | | +-index.twig
    | | | +-index.twig
    ```

## 2. Display the template

`$this->twig->display();`
